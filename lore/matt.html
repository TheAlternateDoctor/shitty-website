                <h2>MATT</h2>
                <p>One of our protagonists. It is a senior chemist, researcher in material recycling, and <a href="/lore/thierry.html">Thierry's</a> coworker.</p>
                <p>Fairly laid back, pretty nonchalant, nothing seems to bother it. It's always ready for any shenanigans its flatmates might be planning.</p>
                <p>It is very into astronomy, it knows the starry sky like the back of its hands<br/>and the best spots to plant its telescope,away from light pollution.</p>
                <p>It's always fascinated by the latest trend in tech. Its visor is a prototype from a cyber implant company;<br/>
                    It can track a fully 3D environment , and it can also superimpose valuable information in its research, such as different notes.<br/>
                    It has also been shown to run Doom (1993) and other misc programs, but it was not exactly <i>official.</i><br/>
                    <a href="/lore/diode.html">Diode</a> kind of bothered Matt enough to try to install homebrew on it, with varying degrees of success.<br/>
                    The visor is extremely modular, thanks to it being a prototype. A few screws hold the LED panel in place, with the full circuit board underneath.

                <p>
                    After Thierry's shenanigans with their own grimoire, it tried some magic itself;<br/>
                    Although Thierry's grimoire didn't lead anywhere, a few archived pages of a divination grimoire it found online did lead to some good results!<br/>
                    Whether it's the stars, coffee stains or Tarot cards, Matt can read the future with some amount of precision.
